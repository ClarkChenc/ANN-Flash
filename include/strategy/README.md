# strategy

This folder contains all implemented graph indexing algorithms. The base class is defined in `solve_strategy.h`, which reads input data through the constructor. The `solve()` function handles both index construction and vector search. Additionally, a `recall()` function is provided to calculate the recall rate. All other files correspond to specific algorithm implementations.
